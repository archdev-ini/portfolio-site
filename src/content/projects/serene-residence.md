## Overview

This project explores how modular construction can create beautiful, affordable, and sustainable housing. The design prioritizes natural light, shared green spaces, and a low environmental footprint.

## Process

The process began with extensive research into sustainable materials and modular building techniques. This was followed by iterative design phases, moving from hand-drawn sketches to detailed 3D models and renderings. Community feedback was incorporated at various stages.

## Outcomes

The final concept includes a detailed site plan, floor plans for various unit types, and a comprehensive sustainability report. The project serves as a blueprint for future developments in the region.
