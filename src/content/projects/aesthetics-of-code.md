## Overview

This essay collection delves into the idea that code can be more than just functional; it can be expressive, elegant, and beautiful. It draws parallels between software architecture and traditional architecture, and between programming languages and natural languages.

## Process

Each essay began as a series of notes and sketches in Obsidian. These were then developed into long-form articles, edited, and published on Substack. The writing process was intentionally public, with drafts shared for feedback.

## Outcomes

The series was well-received, sparking conversations on social media and leading to invitations to speak on podcasts. It has helped to establish a unique voice in the tech and design space.
