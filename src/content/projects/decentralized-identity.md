## Overview

In a world where data is a commodity, this protocol aims to return ownership to the individual. It allows users to create a self-sovereign digital identity that they can use across various online services without compromising their privacy.

## Process

The development is community-driven, following a transparent roadmap. It involves smart contract development, building SDKs for developers, and fostering a community of early adopters and contributors.

## Outcomes

An initial version of the protocol has been deployed on a testnet. The project has garnered a small but active community, and several dApps are exploring integration.
